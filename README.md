This project is heavily inspired by Processing (https://processing.org)
Processing is a marvelous tool I used to use but the lack of some
features (auto-completion and error diagnotics mainly) made me think
it would be way easier to just use a full fledged IDE.

This is why this project exists, it is simply a minimal version of
the most usefull features of processing embeded into a single class
(Sketch) that can be extended to access every convenience method
without importing anything else.

See the Bezier sketch to get an idea of what can be done with this.
